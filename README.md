# Django-Tutorial-VoteApp
A basic voting web-app developed using Django, HTML5, CSS3

This is a web-app developed as part of the DjangoProject Tutorial. It involves creating a voting app using Django, wherein a user will be able to access questions according to their publishing date and will be able to vote on these questions. The results will be displayed to the user on a separate webpage. There has been some basic styling of the webpages - Django templates - by using CSS3. 
An admin user is also created who can access and modify the questions and their choices.
